# PAL Community Report 2025 / Q2
Date: 10.11.2025

This Community report summarizes the activity of the Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) during the period April-June 2025.

## PAL

The Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) is a community-driven initiative that aims to make Polkadot a safer and more attractive place for both builders and users by allocating funds from the Polkadot Treasury ([bounty #22](https://polkadot.subscan.io/bounty/22)) to advance security in Rust / Polkadot SDK.

PAL provides funding for audits (Rust and Solidity), security tooling, bug bounties, and common-good security initiatives. Find out more about the various funding opportunities on [PAL’s homepage](https://dotpal.io).

## Summary
In the period of March through May 2025, PAL provided funding for 2 audits, both of which fall under the "common-good" category.

One of the highlights is an in-depth audit of [Polkadot Frontier](https://github.com/polkadot-evm/frontier) - the EVM compatibility layer used by Moonbeam, Hydration, and others. This initiative - led and fully funded by PAL - allowed us to audit a massive 67,618 LOC of the Frontier codebase, part of which not covered by previous audits. With no critical issues uncovered, we (as an ecosystem) can continue maintaining confidence in the most widely used EVM layer (currently) for Substrate.

Another area of focus for PAL in Q2 was the vetting of vendors for the development of a comprehensive [ecosystem monitoring tool](/rfp/2501). The curators started reviewing the incoming applications **(14 in total)** on RFP 2501 and initiated conversations with the candidate suppliers to clarify the scope of delivery, the price, or other relevant aspects.
