# PAL Community Report 2025 / Q3
Date: 30.12.2025

This Community report summarizes the activity of the Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) during the period July-September 2025.

## PAL

The Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) is a community-driven initiative that aims to make Polkadot a safer and more attractive place for both builders and users by allocating funds from the Polkadot Treasury ([bounty #22](https://polkadot.subscan.io/bounty/22)) to advance security in Rust / Polkadot SDK.

PAL provides funding for audits (Rust and Solidity), security tooling, bug bounties, and common-good security initiatives. Find out more about the various funding opportunities on [PAL’s homepage](https://dotpal.io).

## Summary
In the period of March through May 2025, PAL provided funding for **6 audits**, enabling **5 different teams** to ship secure code. This helped discover more than **30 vulnerabilities**, **10** of which classified as **high-risk**.

The highlight of Q3 was the choice of [Ocelloids](https://www.ocelloids.net/) as vendor for the development of a comprehensive [ecosystem monitoring tool](/rfp/2501). This milestone marked the end of a nearly 4-month long process during which **14 different submissions** were received and vetted. With a resulting shortlist of 4 projects consisting both of big names and smaller vendors, and following an intense, multi-faceted discussion among the curators, Ocelloids was selected for their deep knowledge of the ecosystem, excellent track-record and solid technical approach.
