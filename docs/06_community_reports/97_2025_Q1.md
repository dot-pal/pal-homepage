# PAL Community Report 2025 / Q1
Date: 22.05.2025

This Community report summarizes the activity of the Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) during the period January-March 2025.

## PAL

The Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) is a community-driven initiative that aims to make Polkadot a safer and more attractive place for both builders and users by allocating funds from the Polkadot Treasury ([bounty #22](https://polkadot.subscan.io/bounty/22)) to advance security in Rust / Polkadot SDK.

PAL provides funding for audits (Rust and Solidity), security tooling, bug bounties, and common-good security initiatives. Find out more about the various funding opportunities on [PAL’s homepage](https://dotpal.io).

## Summary
![PAL Community Report 2024 H2](./pal-25q1.jpg)

In the period January-March 2025, PAL has provided funding for 2 parachain audits, 1 security tool, and 1 bug bounty.

The conducted audits helped secure **4,513** lines of code (LOC) and identify a total of **12** vulnerabilities, **4** of which classified as high-risk.

In the [security tooling bucket](/funding/security_tooling), PAL provided funding for the completion of [Scout](https://github.com/CoinFabrik/scout-audit/) - a static analysis tool which enables developers to automatically identify common vulnerabilities in their Substrate runtimes (e.g. unsafe math). You can find more about Scout on our [security tooling](/security_tooling#scout-by-coinfabrik) page.

Furthermore, PAL started a consultation round to collect feedback on its first Request for Proposals (RFP) for the development of an [ecosystem monitoring tool](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/specs-for-an-ecosystem-monitoring-tool-funded-by-pal/12160), denominated [RFP2501](/rfp/2501).

Finally, PAL co-funded for the first time a payout under a [bug bounty program](/funding/bug_bounty).
