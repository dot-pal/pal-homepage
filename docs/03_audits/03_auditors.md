## Selecting an Auditor 

When selecting an auditor for your project:

* Consider their expertise in the specific technologies you're using (e.g., Rust, Substrate, ink!, Solidity).
* Review their past audit reports, if available.
* Consider their familiarity with the Polkadot ecosystem.
* Reach out to multiple auditors to compare quotes and availability.
* Rotate your auditors - consider picking a different supplier for your next audit.

Remember to mention that you're applying under PAL when contacting these auditors.

For any questions about selecting an auditor or if you have a preferred auditor not on this list, please contact the PAL curators.
