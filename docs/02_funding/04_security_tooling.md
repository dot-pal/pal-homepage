description: Common-good Security Tooling for Polkadot
---

PAL can provide funding for the development of open-source security tooling which is made available to the Polkadot ecosystem.

**NOTE:** Funding is on a pause

## Funding
PAL can provide up to **$250,000** funding (in milestones of max. $50,000).

All funding is paid out in DOT using the 7-day DOT EMA price.

## Eligibility Criteria
In order to receive PAL funding, applications need to satisfy all the following criteria:

* The proposal relates to the development or making available of security tooling in Polkadot.
* The security tooling can be deemed useful and beneficial to the wider Polkadot ecosystem.
* The security tooling is novel, meaning that there are no alternatives already existing in Polkadot. If this is not the case, funding may still be granted if redundancy is deemed necessary.
* Proposals exceeding $50,000 are split into milestones, with partial payouts done after reviewing the delivery of every milestone.
* The security tool should be open-source and made available to be used by any Polkadot project.
* Proposals must have well-defined deliverables detailing exactly what the work product will do.
* Proposal budgets must be detailed with a breakdown of man-hours and hourly rates by role. Do not combine all costs and present them at a high level.
* Proposals should be geared more towards a working product, not research.
* Comprehensive documentation of the security tool is part of the expected output. This includes both a user guide on using the tool, and code documentation.
* The ability to demonstrate endorsement of the tool from within the Polkadot ecosystem is an advantage.
* The tool must be integrated with at least one active Polkadot parachain as part of the deliverables, demonstrating real-world usability and effectiveness.
* Applications must specify the period of time the tool will be maintained after development, including regular updates and bug fixes. This maintenance commitment should be clearly defined in the proposal.
* If feasible, a separate maintenance cost proposal for future updates beyond the initial commitment period should be included to ensure the long-term viability of the tool.
