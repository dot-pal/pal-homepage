## Funding

Parachain projects that apply to any of PAL's funding programs can receive a combine total of up to **$100,000** every 6 months.

Through the Audit Funding Program, PAL can cover **up to 80%** of the costs of an audit, with a hard cap of **$100,000**, per project, every 6 months.

The maximum payout amount depends on how long the applicant has been producing blocks on the Polkadot network:

| # Consecutive Cores | # Blocks produced   | Max Payout |
|---------------------|---------------------|------------|
| 1                   | 1 - 403,200         | $ 25,000   |
| 2                   | 403,201 - 806,400   | $ 50,000   |
| 3                   | 806,401 - 1,209,600 | $ 75,000   |
| 4 / Parachain Slot  | 1,209,601 +         | $ 100,000  |

All funding is paid out in DOT using the 7-day DOT EMA price.
