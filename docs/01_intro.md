The Polkadot Assurance Legion (PAL) is a non-profit community initiative which has the mission to promote and advance open-source security in the Polkadot ecosystem, and to make Polkadot a safer and more attractive ecosystem for builders and users.

We provide [funding](/funding) from the Polkadot Treasury towards various security initiatives:

* Funding audits of [parachains](02_funding/01_parachains.md) and [smart contracts](02_funding/02_smart_contracts.md) that are secured by Polkadot.
* Funding audits of [common-good functionality](02_funding/03_common_good.md).
* Funding the development of open-source [Security Tooling](02_funding/04_security_tooling.md) which is made available for the Polkadot ecosystem. 
* Funding other security initiatives that are aligned with PAL's mission.

We also collaborate with industry-leading security experts such as the [Security Alliance](https://securityalliance.org/) to bring their initiatives into Polkadot. 

To learn more about the activities of PAL you can check out our [community reports](/community_reports).
